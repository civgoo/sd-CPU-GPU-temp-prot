# CPU/GPU temperature protection
### Pause image generation when CPU or GPU temperature exceeds threshold
This extension uses nvidia-smi to monitor CPU/GPU temperature at the end of each step, if temperature exceeds threshold pause image generation until criteria are met.

## Requirements
Nvidia GPU

Open Hardware Monitor
https://openhardwaremonitor.org/downloads/ 

This extension was only tested and developed for windows OS. It will likely not work on other OS due to the use of wmi package.

## Installation
- method 1: Install using extensions tab `Available` extensions
- method 2: Install using extensions tab `Install from URL` by manually copying the repository URL
```
https://github.com/civgoo/sd-CPU-GPU-temp-prot
```

## Setting
Settings can be found at `Setting` > `CPU-GPU Temperature`

- `GPU temperature monitor minimum interval`
    - checking temperature too often will reduce image generation performance
    - set to `0` well effectively disable this extension
    - to completely disable extension disable the file extension tab
- `GPU sleep temperature`
    - generation will pause if GPU core temperature exceeds this temperature
- `GPU wake temperature`
    - generation will continue to pause until temperature has drops below this temperature 
    - setting a higher value than `GPU sleep temperature`will effectively disable this
- `Sleep Time`
    - seconds to sleep before checking temperature again
- `Max sleep Time` 
    - max number of seconds that it's allowed to pause
    - generation will continue disregarding `GPU wake temperature` after the allotted time has passed
    - set to `0` disable this limit allowing it to pause indefinitely
- `Print GPU Core temperature while sleeping in terminal`
    - print the GPU core temperature reading from nvidia-smi to console when generation is paused
    - providing information
- `GPU device index`
    - selecting the correct temperature reading for multi GPU systems
    - in most cases and for single GPU system this value should be `0`
 
- Same settings for CPU as well.
- If you have the original extension installed, the gpu settings will only appear on the original extension's setting page

## Notes
- Temperature unit Celsius, Time unit seconds
- This extension will greatly increase the image generation time depending on the settings. Only use this when it is absolutely necessary.
